# Hom-Complex-based-machine-learning

Hom complex based machine learning model for the protein-protein binding affinity changes following mutations. Hom complex is used to characterize the molecular structure and interactions. Further, Hom complex based persistent homology and persistent Euler characterisitc are used as learning descriptors to be fed into machine learning.
